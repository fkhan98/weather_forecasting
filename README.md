Latitude and longitude information for alll 64 districts of Bangladesh are downloaded using `download_latitude_longitude_info.py`
Then, I checked to see if openmeteo client is faster for fetching data or the request library(`get_coolest_10_districts_with_requests.py`). 
The openmeteo client is faster. Thus, the api to fetching the the top 10 coldest district based on the temperature at 2AM for the next 7 days is designed using openmeteo client. The code can be found in `get_coolest_10_districts_api_openmeteoclient.py`. There is scheduler that generates `avg_temp_all_district_for_today.json` containing the average temp for all the district for the current day.(Gets executed at 12AM everyday) The api call only sorts the dictionary and returns the top 10 coldest district and their average temperature. Run the command `python get_coolest_10_districts_api_openmeteoclient.py` to activate the server and a simple get request from postman will show the intended results within 12 ms.


For building the model that predicts the weather at any date in Dhaka, I downloaded the historical data from Jan 2015 - November 5th 2023 from this link `https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api` and trained the prophet model of facebook which was specifically designed for time series forecasting tasks. The training code can be found at `train_weather_forecasting_model.py` file and the inference code can be found at `inference.py`. The api endpoint can be activated by running the command `python api_for_weather_prediction.py` and to hit the endpoint using postman a POST request must be assembled where the form-data consists of key: date and value must be in the format: 2023-12-30 14:00:00 if I want to predict the temperature at 2PM on 30th December 2023.
